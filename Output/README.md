## Description
I wanted an easy Readme Generator

I built this project so as to be able to build a professional readme

It cuts down time as I can build a readme by answering a set of questions

I learnt how to link licenses and badges, also got a better understanding of node
## Installation
you will need to install npm i, you will then need to run node index.js in your CLI to answer a set of questions
## Usage Information
